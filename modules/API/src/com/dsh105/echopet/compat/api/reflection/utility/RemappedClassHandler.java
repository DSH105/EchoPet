/**
 * Used to provide functionality with MCPC+, as MCPC+ remaps the classes in order to
 * let Mods and Plugins work together in harmony. This is however a downside for Plugins
 * since the Plugins will be remapped and the mods remain untouched.
 *
 * For more info/details about this:
 *
 *     The PluginClassLoader:
 *     https://github.com/MinecraftPortCentral/MCPC-Plus/blob/master/patches/org/bukkit/plugin/java/PluginClassLoader.java.patch
 *
 *     The Remapper is one provided by md_5, it's part of his "SpecialSource" project.
 *     It uses some basic ASM to remap the classed of a jar. Fortunately for us, this remapper is easy reachable
 *     and easy to use since we can get the remapped-classnames fairly easy
 *     ( https://github.com/llbit/ow2-asm/blob/master/src/org/objectweb/asm/commons/Remapper.java#L220 )
